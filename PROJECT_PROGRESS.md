# Project Progress - SAM_Windows (2026-Q4)

## Branch

`sow/2026-Q4` - bootstrapped 2026-10-06 from `master` `b6e251d9`. Frozen Q3 record: `sow/2026-Q3` @ `05a8edae` (not modified).

## Last updated

2026-10-06 (Q4 operational cleanup).

## Current status

Q4 branch cut from `master` `b6e251d9`, which is the exact commit pinned in SAM_Deploy's frozen Q3 baseline (`v20261006.1`). Bootstrap added only internal docs (this file, `AGENTS.md`). No product source changed. No Q4 product work has started.

## Q4 priorities

Not yet set by the owner. Record them here at the first Q4 planning pass. Known carry-over work is listed below.

## Known carry-over work

- None identified for this repository at bootstrap.

## Repository-specific next steps

- Await Q4 planning. Open PRs for Q4 work against `sow/2026-Q4`.
- Follow the continuity convention in `AGENTS.md` for every PR and closeout.

## Decisions / assumptions

- Q4 base is `master` `b6e251d9`; the internal files were recovered from `sow/2026-Q3` into this branch only, never onto `master`.
- Q4 history intentionally does not contain the Q3 branch history (the maintained `master` is the promoted Q3 line, which is not a descendant of `sow/2026-Q3`); the frozen `sow/2026-Q3` branch is the permanent record.
- Historical Q2/Q3 content below is kept as evidence; its branch names, SHAs and next steps describe Q3 and are not current instructions.

## Validation

- Bootstrap verified 2026-10-06: `sow/2026-Q4` was created at exactly `b6e251d9` and the push was a normal (non-forced) branch creation.

## Issues / blockers

- None at bootstrap.

## Next step

- Owner to set Q4 priorities; then start the first Q4 task from this branch.

## Q4 operational cleanup (2026-10-06)

- Reviewed every active Q2/Q3 reference in this repository on `sow/2026-Q4` (workflow branch filters, dependency-branch resolution, `.gitmodules`/validation, docs). Historical Q2/Q3 mentions (feature documentation records, the frozen Q3 section below) are intentionally unchanged.
- Changed (`932cc0f`): removed the dead `$candidates += 'sow/2026-Q2'` fallback from the dependency-branch resolution in `.github/workflows/build.yml`. No dependency repository has a `sow/2026-Q2` branch, so the entry never matched and resolution already fell through to the default branch; behaviour is unchanged (PR head ref, current sow ref, then the dependency's default branch) and no per-quarter edit is needed.
- Checked, no action: the `github.repository_owner == 'SAM-BIM'` build guard (intentional; its comment names HoareLea only to explain why the guard exists), CODEOWNERS (SAM-BIM owners), and workflow secrets (no HoareLea-named secret). The local `upstream` (HoareLea) remote is preserved.
- Full cross-repository record, migration table and owner decisions: `SAM_Deploy:sow/2026-Q4` `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`.
